# School Management System

This is a school management system using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java. It has options
for adding students, teachers, and activities to classes, establishing connections between advisors 
and students, inserting assessment grades, among other features.

## SOLID Principles

The program also follows SOLID principles, such as:

- Separating responsibilities into specific classes
- Segregating interfaces and their functionalities
- Making the program scalable and reusable

### Package Organization

Furthermore, the project is structured into packages, such as **app, model, service, and util**, to make it
more understandable and organized, facilitating testing, reuse, and future extensions.

### Data Persistence

A package was also developed to persist received data. The XStream tool was used to assist in the process 
of serializing objects to XML format.
